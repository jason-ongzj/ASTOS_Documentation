## ASTOS Documentation - Sub-Orbital Rocket Trajectory Modelling

This repository contains a few documents for covering how to create a trajectory simulation in ASTOS.

1. UI Overview - Pictorial descriptions of the UI in ASTOS
2. Model Setup - Covers the nuts and bolts of setting up the model in ASTOS
3. Results Analysis - Pictorial descriptions of getting result output as well as data extraction to Excel format

For a deeper understanding of the models within ASTOS, the <a href="https://git.equatorial.space/ESS_Flight_Dynamics/ASTOS_Documentation/src/branch/master/ASTOS%20Reference/Model_Reference.pdf">ASTOS model reference</a> is available.
